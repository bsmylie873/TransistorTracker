# 4. Use GitHub Actions Workflows for our CI/CD Pipeline

Date: 2025-02-10

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need a robust and flexible CI/CD pipeline to automate our build, test, and deployment processes. The chosen solution should integrate seamlessly with our code repository, provide a wide range of pre-built actions, and be easy to configure and maintain. Additionally, it should support our existing workflows and tools.

## Decision

We have decided to use GitHub Actions workflows for our CI/CD pipeline. GitHub Actions is a powerful automation tool that integrates directly with our GitHub repository. It offers a wide range of pre-built actions, supports custom workflows, and provides seamless integration with various third-party services. Our  familiarity with GitHub will reduce the learning curve and increase productivity.

## Consequences

By choosing GitHub Actions, we ensure that our CI/CD pipeline is tightly integrated with our code repository, providing a streamlined and efficient workflow. The wide range of pre-built actions and support for custom workflows will allow us to automate our build, test, and deployment processes effectively. Additionally, the seamless integration with third-party services and the familiarity of us with GitHub will help us maintain and extend our CI/CD pipeline with ease.
