# 2. Use PostgreSQL for our DBMS

Date: 2025-02-04

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need a robust and reliable DBMS to store and manage our application's data. The chosen DBMS should support complex queries, provide high performance, and be scalable to handle future growth. Additionally, it should be familiar to our development team to ensure ease of use and efficient management.

## Decision

We have decided to use PostgreSQL as our DBMS. PostgreSQL is an open-source relational database management system known for its robustness, performance, and extensive feature set. It supports advanced data types, full-text search, and complex queries, making it suitable for our application's requirements.

## Consequences

By choosing PostgreSQL, we ensure that our application will have a reliable and high-performing database system. The familiarity and ease of use will allow us to manage the database efficiently, while the widespread support and community resources will help us address any issues that may arise. Additionally, PostgreSQL's scalability will support our application's growth over time.
